# Web Portfolio Template

Welcome to the Beginner's Web Portfolio Template! This project was cloned and adapted from Sequoia Kanies' [PortfolioWebsite]( https://github.com/ScrumMasterSequoia/PortfolioWebsite), which was generously made available to help budding developers kickstart their own portfolio site.

The template is a minimalist yet powerful web project primarily built with HTML and CSS. It serves as a central hub, showcasing images, information, and links to various projects and files. It's an excellent platform for new developers to practice and enhance their HTML and CSS skills.

One of the key features of this template is its interactive color mode, implemented using vanilla JavaScript. Users can personalize the color scheme of the site by simply clicking on one of the colored dots at the top of the DOM (Document Object Model). This feature not only adds a touch of personalization but also provides a practical example of DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

So, whether you're looking to create a personal portfolio or just want to get your hands dirty with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this template is a great place to start!

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository from GitHub. You can do this by clicking the 'Fork' button at the top right corner of the repository page.

2. **Clone the Repository**:  After forking, clone the repository to your local machine. Replace `<your-username>` and `<repository-name>` with your GitHub username and the name of the forked repository respectively in the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
    ```

3. **Install Live Server Extension**: To run the project locally, install the Live Server extension in VSCode. Once installed, it appears in the bottom right corner of the VSCode window. Right click your index.html file and open with Live Server. To update the live hosted version of the website, use the source control tab (VSCode) and commit the changes to GitHub so that Netlify can auto-deploy for you. (you must set up continuous deployment).

4. **Generate a QR Code for your Website's URL**: To generate a QR code for your website's URL, use a free online QR code generator such as the [Adobe Express QR code creator](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/qr-code-generator). After generating the QR code, download it and save it in the images directory of the project.

## Deployment

We recommend deploying the website on Netlify. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Netlify Account**: If you don't have one, create a new account on Netlify.

2. **Add New Site from GitHub**: Click on the 'Add new site' dropdown and select 'Import an existing project'.

3. **Connect to GitHub**: Choose 'Deploy with GitHub' (assuming you will be using GitHub to deploy your code).

4. **Choose Your Forked Repo**: Select the forked repository to deploy.

5. **Deploy Site**: Click on 'Deploy Site'. Netlify will start the build and deploy process.

## Updating the Website

To update the live hosted version of the website, use the source control tab (VSCode) and commit the changes to GitHub so that Netlify can auto-deploy for you. (you must set up continuous deployment) We recommend that your projects hosted herein have links to the live hosted projects (Netlify or otherwise).

**Pro Tip**: If you make an update and don't see any changes, sometimes you must clear your browsing cookies, data, etc. to avoid reloading outdated file attributes.
